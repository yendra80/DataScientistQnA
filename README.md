****Software Engineering to Data Scientist and Vice Versa****

Broadly speaking, there are two types of data scientists:

- Type A (analyst) data scientists are your traditional PhD types. Scientists, often with a strong math or statistics background, who have transitioned to industry.
- Type B (builder) data scientists are more like machine learning engineers. They’re essentially software engineers who have specialized in developing end-to-end machine learning solutions.

Transitioning from a type A data scientist to full-stack software engineer is fraught with many challenges. These people usually have rudimentary programming skills and have a lot of catching up to do. They’re often perfectionists who tend to overengineer things and struggle to get accustomed to the pragmatism of engineering. Even worse, they may feel that their talent is wasted when developing run-of-the-mill software.

Transitioning from a type B data scientist to full-stack software engineer is much more straightforward. As I mentioned, these people are basically software engineers already. They may need to pick up some new tools if they transition to another domain like full-stack web development, but it doesn’t require a total shift in mindset.

Transitioning from a software engineer to a type B data scientist seems simple enough on the surface. The problem here is that it’s possible to hack together machine learning solutions that appear to make sense but are fundamentally flawed when examined deeper. Functional bugs in software are easily discovered by its users, but it may take time until a machine learning model that’s developed under the wrong assumptions is exposed. So while a type A data scientist can’t fake strong programming skills, it is actually possible for an experienced software engineer to fake machine learning skills. They may know just enough to be dangerous. That being said, it is fully possible to make the transition for a motivated individual who does enough self-study.

Transitioning from a software engineer to a type A data scientist is much harder. It requires a rigorous theoretical foundation that’s extremely hard to pick up outside of academia. Unless they have a relatively recent advanced degree in a quantitative subject they need to put in nearly the equivalent work of getting such a degree.

As a career tip, if you can operate in the intersection of data science and software engineering, as a machine learning engineer or similar, you will be extremely attractive in the job market. There is a greater need for type B than type A data scientists in industry, and most companies have come to realize that by now.
